# Insulin-Precision-Medicine-using-BergmanModel
Using the previous simulation of Glucose and Insulin kinematics via Bergman Minimal Model, we are making a software which can predict how much insulin does a diabetic person need so that their glucose level decreases like a non-diabetic person.


We have taken two sets of parameters: a diabetic person's(params_2) and a normal person's(params_1).
We compare the glucose vs time using Bergman Minimal Model, analyse them and try to determine how much insulin is required to be injected in the patients blood stream so that his blood glucose decreases normaly

Later we even use the data of an IVGTT test and compare it with the glucose-time graph given by the Bergman Minimal Model.
